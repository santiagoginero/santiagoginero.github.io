I was born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela. At age 18 I moved to the US to study physics at Harvard University, graduating in 2024. I am broadly interested in cosmology and (astro)particle physics, with the goal of contributing to our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe and its evolution. Outside of academia, I love running, hiking, swimming, and cycling. I also love cooking (and eating!) and am always looking for new recipes to try out. I practice meditation and am really curious about non-Western philosophy, including Buddhism and Hinduism. I wouldn't say I'm religious per se---just curious about what this thing we call life really is.

In general, I just love learning new things about the world we live in and the humans and other beings that inhabit it. There is so much we know and so much more we don't. It is always good to take a step back and reflect on our insignifance in the world: we have little time in this [mote of dust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g&pp=ygUNcGFsZSBibHVlIGRvdA%3D%3D) suspended on a sunbeam, so we might as well try to enjoy it.

## Why Ubuntu?
In case you were wondering about the title of my site, or are now curious after you read this question and hadn't even noticed the title beforehand, read on (hint: it's not the operating system).

The term *ubuntu* is a Zulu word that literally means "humanity" but encompasses a whole philosophy of being that is all about the interconnectedness of human beings with each other and the world around us. It is often encapsulated in the phrase "I am because we are." In the Western world, we overemphasize the importance of the individual. We say things like "be yourself" or "find your own path," and while it is important to find things in life that truly motivate us as individuals, ultimately we are a social species. Essentially all achievements are the result of collective efforts, and uplifting someone else uplifts us all. I think we could all use a little more *ubuntu* in our lives. I am because you are, because we are.
