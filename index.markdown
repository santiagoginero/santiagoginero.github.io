### Physics, math, and computer science enthusiast. Lover of triathlon and meditation

Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. My name is Santiago and I'm a physics student who just graduated this year, in 2024, from Harvard University. I am currently on a sabbatical year (2024-2025). Here you'll find information on my academic work in physics, notes on books I've read or am currently reading, and some of my writings on other topics I like learning about, including philosophy and psychology. I will warn you that I am not a writer, and if you can call these writings just mere attempts at putting together strings of English words in a somewhat coherent way regarding a slightly interesting topic, then I'd be happy with that compliment :).

If you've stumbled upon this page by accident, which I would think is very likely the case, then probably none of this is of interest to you, which I would 100% understand. In that case, here is a cool picture from the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webbtelescope.org/images) that'll hopefully cheer you up as you marvel at the beauty of our universe.
