I am broadly interested in cosmology and (astro)particle physics, with the overarching goal of advancing our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe. So far, in my undergraduate career, I worked toward this goal in the field of neutrino physics, under the guidance of Professor Carlos Arg√ºelles-Delgado at Harvard University. Neutrinos are one of the most mysterious particles in our current gold-standard theory of elementary particle dynamics: the Standard Model. Many questions about neutrinos remain to be answered, ranging from precise measurements of their mass and other free parameters governing their interactions to whether or not there is a fourth flavor, the so-called sterile neutrino. As such, neutrinos offer tremendous opportunities for not only better understanding the Standard Model but also shedding light on theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM). They have also been studied as potentially forming part of the dark matter (specifically the sterile neutrino) or coupling to a possible dark matter particle.

In particular, I have worked on projects involving:

<ul>
    <li>Data analysis of atmospheric neutrino detection events</li>
    <li>Monte Carlo simulations of atmospheric neutrino detections</li>
    <li>Quantum machine learning for classifying different particle detections</li>
</ul>
